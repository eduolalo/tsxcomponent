Helper for creating React components in TypeScript.

_[mason][1] brick ðŸ§±_

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This brick hepls you to create a basic NextJS component.

### Installation

```bash
mason add -g tsxcomponent --git-url https://github.com/kalmecak/tsxcomponent
```

### Usage

```bash
mason make tsxcomponent -o ./components          
```
Mason will ask for the name of the component, after that it will create a folder with the component name and a `.css` file inside:

```bash
? What the new componets name? (component) button
âœ“ Made brick tsxcomponent (48ms)
âœ“ Generated 2 file(s):
  ./components/Button/Button.module.css (new)
  ./components/Button/Button.tsx (new)
```

After executing the _make_ command your "components" directory will look like this:
```
â””â”€â”€ components
    â””â”€â”€ Button
        â”œâ”€â”€ Button.module.css
        â””â”€â”€ Button.tsx

```

Even if you don't have a "components" directory, it will be created.

Your basic component will look like this:

```tsx
/**
 * Component generated with mason-CLI
 */

import styles from './Navbar.module.css';


const Button = () => {


    return (
        <>
            <h1>Button Component</h1>
            <h2>I'm alive!</h2>
        </>
    );
}

export default Button;
```

Then you can start coding your magic!!
